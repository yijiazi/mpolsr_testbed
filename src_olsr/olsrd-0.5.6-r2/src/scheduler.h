 * Our timer implementation is a based on individual timers arranged in
 * a double linked list hanging of hash containers called a timer wheel slot.
 * For every timer a timer_entry is created and attached to the timer wheel slot.
 * When the timer fires, the timer_cb function is called with the
 * context pointer.
 * The implementation supports periodic and oneshot timers.
 * For a periodic timer the timer_period field is set to non zero,
 * which causes the timer to run forever until manually stopped.
