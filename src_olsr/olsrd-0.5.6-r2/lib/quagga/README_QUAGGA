QUAGGA PLUGIN FOR OLSRD
by Immo 'FaUl' Wehrenberg <immo@chaostreff-dortmund.de>
---------------------------------------------------------------------

This is the Quagga Plugin for the OLSRD. 
It allowes olsrd to redistribute from various quagga-protocols 
as well as to export olsr-routes to quagga so that they can be
redistributed by the quagga-routing-daemons.

Note Sven-Ola: You also need a source distribution of quagga-0.98.5
or quagga-0.98.6 (that is the current stable). The quagga source tree 
needs to be patched with quagga-0.98.6-olsr.diff, compiled and installed
via 'make install'. Because many people will otherwise have compile
probs, I've added 2 include files in lib/quagga/src/quagga. If you
want to use another version of quagga, make sure to remove these
before you compile the olsrd_quagga plugin.
